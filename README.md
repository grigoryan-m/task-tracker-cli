# Task tracker cli
This is the project from roadmap.sh, but I didn't use json and just saved ArrayList of tasks in the file, cause it's much easier.
Commands:
add "Description" — Adds tasks to list
update 0 "Description" — Updates description of a task with given ID
delete 0 — Deletes task with given ID
mark-in-progress — Marks task "in progress"
mark-done — Marks task "done"
list [_/todo/in_progress/done] — Lists all the tasks or tasks with given status
